Rules Of Communication

Section 1 - General Rules: 
ADs Format:
For selling: Selling‚ÜíPrice
Example: Selling pants for men. Price: Negotiable.
For selling/trading: Selling or trading‚ÜíPrice
Example: Selling or trading "Ubermacht M5 (E34)". Price: Negotiable.
For trading only: Trading (Price does not need to be mentioned in this case)
Example: Trading "Ubermacht M5 (E34)".
! - You cannot edit ADs that involve items from different categories. For instance, you cannot trade a car for a house or business, and vice versa. 
For buying: Buying‚ÜíBudget
Example: Buying seeds. Budget: Negotiable.
Looking to buy changes to Buying.
Example: Looking to buy a house ‚Üí Buying a house. Budget: Negotiable.
For selling and buying, if the price or budget is not mentioned, we add it as:
Price: Negotiable. Or Budget: Negotiable.
Example: 
	Raw add: Buying a house ‚Üí Buying a house. Budget: Negotiable.
A colon (:) is always put after Price or Budget. 
Example: Buying seeds. Budget: Negotiable.
Money Formats:
 A dollar sign ($) must be used before the numerical value.
If the AD ends with a numerical value, then there is no need for a period (.)
Example: Price: $4.000
                 Price: $4 Million.
K is not used to represent a thousand and M is not used to represent a million. Write the full amount for thousands and the amount with Million for millions.
Examples: 
	$1k ‚Üí $1.000
	$10k ‚Üí $10.000
	$100k ‚Üí $100.000
	$1m ‚Üí $1 Million.
	$14m ‚Üí $14 Million.
	$4.5m ‚Üí $4.5 Million.
We use a period (.) for numerical values, instead of a comma (,)
Example: $1.000 (NOT $1,000)
If the numerical value is higher than $1 Billion, it changes to Negotiable except houses and business.
Example:
Raw ad: Selling a car. Price 2 Billion 
          ‚Üí Selling a car. Price: Negotiable.
Houses and businesses can be over $1 Billion.
If someone is buying/selling a house for under $1 Million, change it to Negotiable.
If someone is buying/selling an apartment for under $2 Million, change it to Negotiable.

NOTES
Use clothing list and vehicle list documents for the exact format of clothing items/accessories and cars/bikes/planes/helicopters.
Brands and locations should be capitalised (check section).
When there is a specific amount of items in the AD, the numerical value needs to include a period (.)
Example:
	Selling 1.000 seeds. Price: Negotiable.
Double check that the AD is correct before posting it.
Remember to select the correct category for each AD.
Trading 2 items of DIFFERENT categories no longer goes under the OTHER category. You cannot edit ADs that involve items from different categories. For instance, you cannot trade a car for a house or business, and vice versa. 
You have the right to reject an AD if it is improper, incomprehensible or offending in any way.
Some ADs that get rejected should also be blacklisted (check section 1.2)

Section 2 - Real Estate: 
General Rules
A maximum of TWO properties per AD is allowed.

If the sender mentions the number of the property, use the number symbol (‚Ññ). 
Example: Selling house ‚Ññ758. Price: Negotiable.
A property can only have 2, 5, 9 or 25 garage spaces. Use the abbreviation g.s. to represent them.
Example: Selling a house with 5 g.s. Price: Negotiable.
A property can only have 3, 4 or 5 warehouse spaces. Use the abbreviation w.h. to represent them.
Example: Selling a house with 4 w.h. Price: Negotiable.
If a property has insurance there is no need to mention how many days. 
Example: Selling a house with insurance. Price: Negotiable.
We are allowed to put -> with a garden, insurance, view and other extra stuff like tennis court, swimming pool, helipad, long driveway etc.
Example: Selling a house with a garden, helipad and swimming pool. Price: Negotiable.
Order of the features in a real estate AD:
1) garden
2) garage spaces (2 g.s., 5 g.s. or 9 g.s., 25 g.s.)
3) warehouse spaces (3 w.h., 4 w.h. or 5 w.h.)

Selling an apartment with 9 g.s., custom interior, insurance and a great view in the Casino. Price: Negotiable.
We are allowed to mention custom interior, if the sender mentions that the property is furnished or has different interiors. !CAREFUL! We CAN NOT mention the nationalities in the interiors (italian interior, russian interior, chinese interior).
Example: Selling an apartment with 9 g.s. and custom interior. Price: Negotiable.
If the customer mentioned two houses, we need to use the plural forms of the following:
garden ‚Üí gardens
helipad ‚Üí helipads
tennis court ‚Üí tennis courts 
long driveway ‚Üí long driveways 
swimming pool ‚Üí swimming pools
Insurance and custom interior will remain the same without "S"
Example:

Selling 2 houses with gardens, helipads, tennis courts, long driveways and swimming pools. Price: Negotiable.

Selling houses ‚Ññ5 and ‚Ññ767 with gardens, 25 g.s., insurance and swimming pools. Price: Negotiable.

Renting a property
Instead of using Selling // Price, we use Renting out // Rent. 
Instead of using Buying // Budget, we use Looking to rent // Budget. 
Example:	Renting out house ‚Ññ758. Rent: Negotiable.
                	Looking to rent a house. Budget: Negotiable.
!CAREFUL! Renting out means you are giving your house to someone else for rent, looking to rent means you are looking for a house to rent!
A property can be rented per day or per week.
Example:	Renting out a house. Rent: $200.000 for 7 days.
         	     	Renting out a house. Rent: $200.000 per week.
Always put two periods on abbreviations g.s. and w.h. even if a comma comes after. Example: with a garden, 9 g.s., 5 w.h. and swimming pool. 
DO NOT mention the green zone or any gang location or name.
Instead of villa, use mansion.
  e.g. Selling a mansion. Price: Negotiable.
          Selling mansion ‚Ññ25. Price: Negotiable.
Instead of Casino apartment, use Casino penthouse.
  e.g. Selling a Casino penthouse. Price: Negotiable.

Rules Of Communication
Keep your radio on during work by pressing F5.
Correct your colleagues if you see them making a mistake using radio chat or the radio. (Senior 1+ ONLY)
Use a calm tone when correcting your colleagues and do not ever raise your tone or correct aggressively.
Know that it is our job to correct each other so we do not repeat mistakes and that we are not targeting you for any reason, our job relies on us posting ads flawlessly to the eyes of the public.
Once corrected, reply to us so we know you acknowledged the mistake. 
Use the radio for work purposes only!

Templates:
We can not post ADs for the templates of the same business / office back to back as it will be considered as unnecessary spamming. If there are no ADs except for the templates of a particular business / office, you need to wait for 3 ADs to come and get published before posting the same template twice. If different businesses / offices are being advertised, you are allowed to post these ADs. The only exception is to make sure not to post the same business / office templates over and over again without the necessary gaps in the publishing board.
